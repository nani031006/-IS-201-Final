               New Zealand is a gorgeous country. Outside of Auckland, the countryside is amazing but the roads to get anywhere are hard to navigate and the average speed limit is 50 miles per hours. My family is from there so this is the country that I have visited the most. It is my favorite place on earth and the food is so good. Mincemeat pies, fish and chips, and the best butter chicken outside of India.
