         Rome is an amazing city with so many sites to see and visit. From the Parthenon and other ancient roman architecture to the Vatican. The best way to really see it all fast is to set two days to see it all. One to visit all the sites in the city and the other day for the Vatican. The Trevi fountain is easier to see in the morning as the city likes to sleep in and you'll have it all to yourself, but I would book the night tour of the Colluseum to get the full backstage tour and get to go under the structure itself. </p>
