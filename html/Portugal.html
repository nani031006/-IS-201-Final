          Portugal was a gorgeous country. The people are really welcoming. Outside of Lisbon and Porto, the countryside is amazing but the people are still very traditionally Catholic and are very communal. The food is amazing and the dollar-to-euro value goes the furthest in Portugal than in any other European Union country. All the cars are manual, but you can still drive on the right side of the road. There are a lot of traditional Portuguese castles and ruins, but also much older Moorish ruins as well.

          Lisbon is the capital of Portugal. It is a very hilly city with a lot of old architecture. The people are very friendly and the food is amazing. There is actually the oldest Pasteis de Nata store in the world in Lisbon. The city is very walkable, but there are also trams and buses to help you get around. The nightlife is very lively, and there are many bars and clubs to choose from.
